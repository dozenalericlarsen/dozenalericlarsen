Here is my best attempt to describe the base-12 calulator:
Large buttons, easy to use, friendly design.
Has all the numerals 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,(), and a decimal place .
The numerals A and B could possibly be switched. X for the A, and an inverted 3 for the B. Numeral three should then have a flat top. 
The mathematical functions are only +, -, *, /, and =
There is a clear button to clear the screen.
There is a delete button to delete the previous input.
There is a display that can accommodate four rows of numbers, each 24-30 characters in length.
When a large calculation is performed and the answer is longer than the four rows of digits, the screen can be scrolled down to reveal the answer. 
Screen scroll down also reveals previous calculations.
Very large calucations can be performed where numbers up to 1000 numerals may be accomodated under the scroll down screen.
Math questions and answers are different colours, question = white, answer = yellow.
Math symbols +,-,*,/ are blue.
Question takes place upper left of screen, which is top row of the four rows of numerals.
Answer appears bottom right of the screen, which is the bottom row of the four rows, and just above the scroll down screen.
Answers can be used to perform next function, where +,-,*,/ can be applied to the answer to the previous equation.
Invalid questions or input results in: "Invalid Format" response.
Answers with repeating decimals are not rounded off after a short length but go for 120 iterations before ending.
